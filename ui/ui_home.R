    The data set that we will be using is a tropical cyclone history database in a format known as HURDAT 
    (HURricane DATabase). It was collected by the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane 
    Center sourced by Kaggle [1]. It consists of data from post-storm analyses, that may not have been available in 
    real time, of each tropical cycloneâ€™s location, wind, and pressure in the North Pacific Ocean. This data set 
    is ongoing review of past analysis and updates appropriately to reflect any changes.'),
