    The data set that we will be using is a tropical cyclone history database in a format known as HURDAT 
    (HURricane DATabase). It was collected by the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane 
    Center sourced by Kaggle [1]. It consists of data from post-storm analyses, that may not have been available in 
    real time, of each tropical cycloneâ€™s location, wind, and pressure in the North Pacific Ocean. This data set 
    is ongoing review of past analysis and updates appropriately to reflect any changes.'),

    is given to show why it is relevant. The status of the tropical cyclone is provided to indicate its category of
